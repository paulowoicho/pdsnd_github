# Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code in this repository imports the relevant datasets and answers interesting questions about them by computing descriptive statistics. This information is presented to the user via an interactive experience in the terminal using the user's raw input.

## Files used
The datasets used for this project were gotten from the Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program:

They include:
- chicago.csv : Bikeshare data for Chicago
- new_york_city.csv : Bikeshare data for New York
- washington.csv : Bikeshare data for Washington

## Running the Project

To test the project's functionality, you should run it in a virtual environment. You can read [this tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to learn how to create and activate virtual environments in python for your operating system.

After activating your virtual environment, make sure you `cd` into the project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the relevant modules. You can then run `python bikeshare.py` to interact with the project!
